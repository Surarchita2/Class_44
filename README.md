(WH) Game Design and Planning:

1. What is the title of your application?
PacMan

2. What is the storyline of your application?
The storyline of the application is that it is a Pizza who has lost part of itself and is trying to get it back from the ghosts who have stolen it.

3. What is the goal of the application?
The goal of the application is that you have to help PacMan find all his parts to become whole and you have to do it multiple times.

4. What is the motivation/inspiration behind the idea?
The motivation behind the idea is a size who has lost a slice of itself.

5. What are the different characters of the application?
The different characters are: The main player (PacMan), The Ghosts (4 different colors), The lost parts of PacMan, Power-Ups (Cherry, Bubble Gum). There are also the distributed parts of PacMan and the Maze.

6. What is the behavior of each character? 
The Main, Player PacMan, goes through the maze and has to collect all it’s parts without getting eaten by using the arrow keys. The ghosts slowly get released one by one and try to stop pacMan from finding all of himself.
When the Parts f PacMan get consumed by PacMan, it strengthens him and gives him points. The bubble gum lets him get more points by attacking the ghosts. The Cherry gives him a boost of points and the Maze helps keep PacMan inside the allotted area.

7. What are the elements of skill? (Based off player’s skill)
The elements of skill are the levels. As you collect all the lost bits of PacMan, you will go to the next level.

8. What are the elements of chance? (Based of the game’s intensity)
The elements of change are fair. The game starts out fairly simple and its intensity increases as you level up. In addition, the speed of the ghosts also increase.

9. How does the application provide a balance between the elements of skill and chance?
The game provides a balance of elements and skills by starting out simple and increases its intensity as you level up. This also includes elements of skill as it doesn’t start out super hard.

The game provides feedback to the player by having levels, lives, and points.
